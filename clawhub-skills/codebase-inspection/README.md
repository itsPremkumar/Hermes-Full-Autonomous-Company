## What it does

You can't manage codebase metrics you can't measure — and you can't see trends over time. Codebase Inspector solves this: Walk any directory and report language breakdowns, line counts, blank/comment lines, with HTML reports, git-aware diffs, trend tracking, SVG badges, CSV export, and CI integration.

**Best for:** Engineering leads, open-source maintainers, and CI pipelines.

## Features

- **Print a per-language LOC report**
- **Export CSV for dashboards**
- **Generate an HTML report**
- **Git-aware diff between snapshots**
- **Track trends and emit an SVG badge**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/codebase-inspection/main/codebase_inspector.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```
