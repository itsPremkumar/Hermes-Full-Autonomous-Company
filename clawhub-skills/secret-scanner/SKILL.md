## What it does

Secrets leak into repos constantly and go unnoticed until exploited. Secret Scanner solves this: Detect API keys, tokens, and credentials in code with 50+ patterns, entropy analysis, and SARIF reports.

**Best for:** Security teams, maintainers, and CI pipelines.

## Features

- **Scan a path for secrets**
- **List detection patterns**
- **Emit SARIF for CI**
- **Filter by severity**
- **Skip entropy check**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/secret-scanner/main/secret_scanner.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```

## Quick start

```bash
python secret_scanner.py self-test     # prove it works end-to-end
python secret_scanner.py scan --help   # scan subcommand
python secret_scanner.py check --help   # check subcommand
python secret_scanner.py list-patterns --help   # list-patterns subcommand
```

## Use cases

1. Scan a path for secrets
1. List detection patterns
1. Emit SARIF for CI
1. Filter by severity
1. Skip entropy check

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| grep for keys | Pattern + entropy detection. |
| Single-pattern tools | 50+ patterns in one pass. |
| Manual review | SARIF drops into CI. |

## FAQ (SEO / AEO)

**Q: Patterns?**  
A: 50+ built in (keys, tokens, creds).

**Q: Entropy?**  
A: On by default; disable with --no-entropy.

**Q: SARIF?**  
A: Yes — --sarif for GitHub code scanning.

**Q: Offline?**  
A: Yes.
