## What it does

Autonomous agents need governance or they drift and take bad actions. Autonomous Company OS solves this: Run a self-improving autonomous company from a single CONSTITUTION plus a confidence-gated loop.

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| Ad-hoc cron scripts | A governed loop with escalation, not raw automation. |
| Hiring | Agents execute defined work at ~$0 marginal cost. |
| Docs only | An operating system, not a README. |

## FAQ (SEO / AEO)

**Q: What is the CONSTITUTION?**  
A: A Markdown charter of operating rules the loop obeys.

**Q: Is it safe?**  
A: Low-confidence actions are escalated, not executed blindly.

**Q: Offline?**  
A: Yes — pure stdlib loop.

**Q: Can I fork it?**  
A: Yes — MIT, designed to be your company's OS.
