## What it does

Knowing what changed on disk — and when — is manual without a tool. File Watcher solves this: Monitor directories for changes: snapshots, diffs, glob filtering, and event detection.

**Best for:** Automation builders, agents, and ops monitoring config/data.

## Features

- **Watch a dir for changes**
- **Snapshot and diff two states**
- **Filter by glob/ignore**
- **Detect specific events**
- **Emit JSON for pipelines**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/file-watcher/main/file_watcher.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```

## Quick start

```bash
python file_watcher.py self-test     # prove it works end-to-end
python file_watcher.py watch --help   # watch subcommand
python file_watcher.py once --help   # once subcommand
python file_watcher.py diff --help   # diff subcommand
```

## Use cases

1. Watch a dir for changes
1. Snapshot and diff two states
1. Filter by glob/ignore
1. Detect specific events
1. Emit JSON for pipelines

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| inotify scripts | Cross-platform polling + glob filtering. |
| diff two trees by hand | Snapshots make it one command. |
| Guessing what changed | Event-level detection. |

## FAQ (SEO / AEO)

**Q: Polling?**  
A: Yes — --poll-interval for non-inotify platforms.

**Q: Filters?**  
A: --glob and --ignore.

**Q: Diff?**  
A: snapshot_a/snapshot_b diff mode.

**Q: Offline?**  
A: Yes.
