## What it does

Token spend balloons silently across agents and models with no per-agent accountability. LLM Cost & Token Tracker solves this: Estimate and tally LLM API spending per agent/session with budget alerts and CSV export.

**Best for:** Founders, finops, and agent operators running multi-agent LLM workloads on GPT/Claude/Gemini.

## Features

- **Estimate cost before sending a prompt**
- **Tally spend from agent run logs**
- **Set per-agent budget alerts**
- **Export a CSV for finance**
- **Compare model pricing at a glance**

## Install

```bash
# Requires Python 3.8+. No pip install needed.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsPremkumar/agent-cost-tracker/main/agent_cost_tracker.py
# Or copy the file anywhere — it's self-contained.
```

## Quick start

```bash
python agent_cost_tracker.py self-test     # prove it works end-to-end
python agent_cost_tracker.py tally --help   # tally subcommand
python agent_cost_tracker.py estimate --help   # estimate subcommand
```

## Use cases

1. Estimate cost before sending a prompt
1. Tally spend from agent run logs
1. Set per-agent budget alerts
1. Export a CSV for finance
1. Compare model pricing at a glance

## Why choose this over alternatives

| Alternative | Why this skill is better |
|---|---|
| Cloud billing dashboards | Per-agent, per-session granularity you control locally. |
| Mental math on token counts | Price tables + estimation remove the guesswork. |
| Spreadsheet tracking | CSV export drops straight into your existing finance stack. |
